# Neural Networks

## Steps to implement
1. Calculate forward prop & cost function (regularization if need)
2. Calculate backward prop (regularization if need)
3. Gradient Checking to make sure hte backward prop is correct.
4. Randomly initialize of Theta

## How to use it?
1. Go to `ex4.m`, change the parameters to whatever you want.
2. Change the `load('ex4data1.mat')` to any training set that you want
3. Change the `input_layer_size` and `output_layer_size` and `hidden_layer_size` accordinately.
4. Click `run` in the matlab.
