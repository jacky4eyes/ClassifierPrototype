## How to use Git

### If you do not have a repository
- `git clone`: to download a new repository

### If you already have a repository
- `cd` to your repository
- `git fetch`: to get newest version
- Coding, or changing files
- `git status` to see the current modified/delete files
- `git add .` to added all modified/delete files
- `git commit -m "summary"`: to add commit "summary" to all your added files
- `git push`: push the commit to the remote github

**Remember to push all your work before you leaving the desktop, that could reduce the conflicts when cooperate with peers**
